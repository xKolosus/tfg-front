# ProyectoTFGFront

And this is the front part, mostly in Angular, and it was a long ago so some libraries may be deprecated or with security issues.
This wasn't my brilliant part of the project, but I still have enjoyed creating components, listing the items, and making the calls and if any
event was thrown to interact with it and realize some actions to the page.

As in the back part, any improvement you could see, with any new version or any other architecutre, etc... Is good received.

Thanks!
